We verified it was working correctly by uploading some demo code to make an onboard LED blink at \\(1\\) Hz.\nThe rest of the lab consisted of making some combinational logic to turn on onboard LEDs in addition to making another onboard LED blink at \\(2.4\\) Hz and more combinational logic to display a digit in a 7-Segment-Display depending on the binary input. This is shown below.\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nLogic\n\n\n\n\nS[0:1]\nOnboard Led 0\nXOR\n\n\nS[2:3]\nOnboard Led 1\nAND\n\n\n\\(48\\) Mhz Oscillator\nOnboard Led 2\n2.4 Hz Blinking\n\n\nS[0:6]\n7 Segment Display\nBinary Decoder\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Setup\nI followed the Lab 1 guide for assembling and soldering my development board in addition to the interactive site.\n\n\n\n\nMCU and FPGA Development Board\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard Backside View\n\n\n\n\n\nRibbon Extender Connection\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculations\nAssuming our 7 Segment Display LEDs have a drop of 2V and we want to restrict the current flow through the display to less than 20 milliamps. Using Ohm’s Law: \\(V = IR\\) we can rearrange to solve for resistance: \\(R = \\frac{V}{I}\\). Then plugging in our values: \\(\\frac{[3.3 V - 2 V] - 0 V}{20 \\times 10^{\\3} A} = 65 \\Omega\\). So I will use a resistor larger than \\(65 \\Omega\\), the nearest size up stocked in the Engineering Stockroom being \\(68 \\Omega\\), restricting the current through the display to \\(19\\) mA of current.\n\n\nMethods\nI broke up the required tasks into different Verilog modules. In the following block diagram you can see each of my modules and how they fit together.\n\n\n\nBlock Diagram\n\n\nThe modules can be found here in my github.\n\n\nSchematic\nThe schematic for the circuit includes the FPGA, DIP switches, LEDs, and 7-segment display.\n\n\n\nSchematic\n\n\n\n\nSimulations\nI created a testbench for each of the modules I made. The testbenches loads testvectors that simulate all of the combinational logic of switches and LED and 7 Segment Display outputs against each other to make sure the outputs are what I expect when the module is run. You can see below my waveforms generated from my 3 simulations\n\n\n\n\nTop Level Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED Module\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Segment Display Module\n\n\n\n\nThe top level module ran 16 tests with 0 errors !\n\n\nHardware Testing\n\n\n\nOscilloscope Trace of led[2] pin 42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Prototype\nI used Gemini’s 2.5-Pro model for this section of the assignment.\nI prompted the AI with: “Write SystemVerilog HDL to leverage the internal high speed oscillator in the Lattice UP5K FPGA and blink an LED at 2 Hz. Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.”.\nCompiling the given code resulted in 1 error and 12 warnings: Error 35901063 Synthesis ERROR &lt;35901063&gt; - c:/users/abrah/onedrive/documents/lab1_ai/source/impl_1/lab1_ai.sv(21): instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC. VERI-1063 [lab1_ai.sv:21]\nIt simply suggested I didn’t have the module installed but it was trying to access a oscillator not compatible with our board. I fixed the oscillator declaration for it then it compiled fine.\n\n\nResults\nAll lab requirements were met. The E155 development board is fully assembled and operational, except for a broken ribbon cable connector that needs replacement. The FPGA is programmed with synthesized Verilog, successfully driving the LEDs and 7-segment display as specified. Both simulation and hardware tests confirm correct operation, with the 7-segment display showing all digits clearly and equally bright."

    "text": "Hours spent on lab: 15 Hours\n\nHours procrastinated: 45 Hours :(\n\n\n\nOverview\nIn this lab, expanding on our 7-segment-display knowledge from Lab 1, we controlled a two digit 7-segment-display with the same pins via multiplexing the power pins based on the clock signal. Controlling each segment with independent combinational logic, we toggle between them fast enough to appear as if they are both independently running. Finally, we display the sum of the two numbers displayed on the digits as a binary sum in the form of LEDs.\n\n\nHardware Setup\nOur FPGA has 18 GPIO pins available for use. The two 7-segment-displays require 7 pins for each segment, and 2 pins for powering them (while an inverter chip could’ve been used, it would’ve been more to breadboard and the pin was available for use). 4 Input pins for the DiP switches and 5 output pins for the summation LEDs, so we utilized all available programmable pins on our FPGA. This is my breadboard:\n\n\n\nLab 2 Circuit Breadboard\n\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nTransistor Current through the Base:\nThe drop of the diode in the transistor is \\(V_{BE} = 700 mV\\). Due to this drop, the Base is at \\(2.6 V\\) and the collector is at \\(3.3 V - 250 mV = 3.05 V\\). If our red 7-Segment-Display Diodes have a drop of \\(1.8V\\) … and a safe current into our FPGA is around \\(5 mA\\) so we can also see our diode light up. \\(\\frac{3.05 - 0}{5 * 10^{-3}} = 610 \\Omega\\). So for our power driving resistors … we can safely use a \\(610 \\Omega\\) Resistor or larger.\n\n\nDriving single LEDs\nSince our single red LEDs have a drop of about \\(1.8 V\\), \\(\\frac{3.3 V - 1.8 V}{10*10^{-3} A} = 100 \\Omega\\).\n\n\nDriving 7-Segment-Display\nSince our 7-Segment-Display red LEDs have a drop of about \\(1.8 V\\), \\(\\frac{3.1 V - 1.8 V}{5*10^{-3} A} = 260 \\Omega\\). (From \\(3.1 V\\) due to Transistor Collector).\n\n\n\nMethods\nI broke up the required tasks into different Verilog modules.

It also instantiated a high-speed oscillator for timing, which I had to fix in my own implementation due to synthesis errors. The AI’s code provided a good reference for structuring the multiplexing clock logic and handling two sets of input bits. I can appreciate how it does everything in hex too to make things a bit more readable.\nFor the next prompt: “Write SystemVerilog HDL to time multiplex a single seven segment decoder (that decodes from four bits to a common anode seven segment display) to decode two sets of input bits and drive two sets of seven output bits. Use the seven segment decoder and oscillator provided in the attached files.” It again did a good job that compiled and the logic looked like it would perform well upon upload.\n\n\nResults\nAll lab requirements were met. Human eye cannot tell the flickering of my multiplexing at 60Hz. All combinations work with little to no bleed of lights or colors."

We begin to make some set-up files for our Microcontroller STM32L432KCUx to access its internal clock, GPIO clocks, and Timer clocks to generate electrical pulses and delays in the form of square waves.\n\n\nHardware Setup\nI followed figure 9-5 on the LM386 datasheet using the audio amplifier. To create my breadboard:\n\n\n\nBreadboard\n\n\n\n\nSchematic\nThe schematic for the circuit includes the MCU, Piano switches, Push-Buttons, and the LM386 Audio Amplifier.\n\n\n\nSchematic\n\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nDelay\nGiven the following formulas:\n\n\\(f_{timer}=\\frac{f_{clk}}{PSC+1}\\)\n\\(f_{reload}=\\frac{f_{timer}}{ARR+1}\\)\n\\(T=\\frac{PSC+1}{f_{clk}}\\times (ARR+1)\\)\n\nHardcoding PSC for delay as 2500, we can use our first equation \\(f_{timer}=\\frac{80 * 10^6 Hz}{2501} \\approx 31987.2 Hz\\). We can then use our 3rd equation to see our minimum and maximum delay depending on what \\(ARR\\) is set as as the incrementer.\nMinimum (ARR = 1): \\(T=\\frac{2501}{80 * 10^6 Hz}\\times (2) \\approx 62.5 \\mu s\\).\nMaximum (ARR = 65635 = 0xFFFF): \\(T=\\frac{2501}{80 * 10^6 Hz}\\times (65535) \\approx 2.05 s\\).\n\n\n\nPulse Width Modulation\nGiven the following formula:\n\n\\(f_{pwm}=\\frac{f_{clk}}{(PSC+1)(ARR+1)}\\)\n\nMinimum (largest PSC and ARR): \\(f_{pwm}=\\frac{80 * 10^6 Hz}{65535^2} \\approx 18.627 mHz\\)\nMaximum (smallest PSC and ARR): \\(f_{pwm}=\\frac{80 * 10^6 Hz}{2} = 40 MHz\\)\nSo let’s go through some examples to see how accurate our production is even with the rounding and integer division taking place.\n78 Hz (Eb2):\n\\(D = \\frac{80*10^6}{78} \\approx 1025641.03\\).\nSo my code would choose a PSC Value of \\(\\frac{1025641.03}{65536} - 1 \\approx 15.65 - 1\\).\nI use ceil to round numbers with a decimal of 0.5 or more to the next largest integer so we end up getting \\(16 - 1 = 15\\).\nIt would then calculate a ARR Value of \\(\\frac{1025641.03}{15 + 1} \\approx 64102.56\\).\nI use round to bring down numbers with a decimal of less than 0.5 to the next smallest integer getting us \\(64103\\).\nThen calculating \\(f_{clk} = \\frac{80*10^6 Hz}{PSC * ARR} = \\frac{80*10^6 Hz}{16 * 64103} \\approx 77.995\\).\nWe have an error of \\(\\frac{77.995 - 78}{78} \\approx -0.0064 \\%\\).\n440 Hz (A4):\n\\(D = \\frac{80*10^6}{440} \\approx 181818.\\overline{18}\\).\nSo my code would choose a PSC Value of \\(\\frac{181818.\\overline{18}}{65536} - 1 \\approx 2.8 - 1\\).\nI use ceil to round numbers with a decimal of 0.5 or more to the next largest integer so we end up getting \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\nIt would then calculate a ARR Value of \\(\\frac{181818.\\overline{18}}{2 + 1} \\approx 60606.06\\).\nI use round to bring down numbers with a decimal of less than 0.5 to the next smallest integer getting us \\(60606\\).\nThen calculating \\(f_{clk} = \\frac{80*10^6 Hz}{PSC * ARR} = \\frac{80*10^6 Hz}{181818} = 440.00044\\).\nWe have an error of \\(\\frac{440.00044 - 440}{440} = 0.0001 \\%\\).\n1568 Hz (G6):\n\\(D = \\frac{80*10^6}{1568} \\approx 51020.41\\).\nSo my code would choose a PSC Value of \\(\\frac{51020.41}{65536} - 1 \\approx 0.77 - 1\\).\nI use ceil to round numbers with a decimal of 0.5 or more to the next largest integer so we end up getting \\(1 - 1 = 0\\).\nIt would then calculate a ARR Value of \\(\\frac{51020.41}{0 + 1} \\approx 51020.41\\).\nI use round to bring down numbers with a decimal of less than 0.5 to the next smallest integer getting us \\(51020\\).\nThen calculating \\(f_{clk} = \\frac{80*10^6 Hz}{PSC * ARR} = \\frac{80*10^6 Hz}{51021} \\approx 1567.97\\).\nWe have an error of \\(\\frac{1567.97 - 1568}{1568} \\approx -0.0019 \\%\\).\n\n\n\nVerification\n\n\n\n\n\n500 Hz Trace\n\n\nPercent Error = \\(\\frac{497.22 - 500}{500} \\approx 0.56 \\%\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1000 Hz Trace\n\n\nPercent Error = \\(\\frac{994.1 - 1000}{1000} \\approx 0.59 \\%\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5000 Hz Trace\n\n\nPercent Error = \\(\\frac{4973.7 - 5000}{5000} \\approx 0.53 \\%\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Prototype\nThis week I prompted Claude AI with “What timers should I use on the STM32L432KC to generate frequencies ranging from 220Hz to 1kHz? What’s the best choice of timer if I want to easily connect it to a GPIO pin? What formulae are relevant, and what registers need to be set to configure them properly?”. For additional context, I was able to upload the Datasheet and Reference Manual to the AI so it could potentially go through and not hallucinate registers.\n\n\nClaude AI Response Summary\n\n\nRecommended Timer: TIM2 (32-bit general-purpose timer)\n\n\n\nBest for 220Hz-1kHz range due to 32-bit counter flexibility\n\n\n4 channels available for PWM output\n\n\nEasy GPIO mapping via alternate functions\n\n\n\nKey Formula:\n\nf_output = f_timer / ((PSC + 1) × (ARR + 1))\n\nWhere f_timer is typically 80 MHz, PSC is the prescaler value, and ARR is the auto-reload value.\n\n\nEssential Registers:\n\n\n\nTIMx_PSC - Prescaler (divides clock)\n\n\nTIMx_ARR - Auto-reload register (defines period)\n\n\nTIMx_CCRx - Capture/compare (sets duty cycle)\n\n\nTIMx_CCMR - Set to PWM mode (OCxM = 110 or 111)\n\n\nTIMx_CCER - Enable channel output\n\n\nTIMx_CR1 - Enable counter\n\n\n\nExample (440Hz): With 80 MHz clock, PSC=79, ARR=2272 gives 440.05 Hz\n\n\nGPIO Connection: Configure pin alternate function per datasheet tables (e.g., PA0 = TIM2_CH1 with AF1)\n\n\nI think it did a good job with this response. From my understanding of the reference manual, TIM2 is one of the more robust timers on our microcontroller and could definitely be used to produce a PWM signal.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe design worked as intended.
